<h1>Re: Albert Momo university application</h1><br>
<hr>

Dear Mr. Momo,<br>
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University’s science faculty to study<br>
as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
<h1>Starting dates</h1>
We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit<br>
us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as
follows:<br><br>
First semester: 9 October 2022<br>
Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>
Third semester: 2 May 2023<br><br>
Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br><br>
You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
<h1>Subjects of study</h1>
At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects<br>
fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated<br>
researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas<br>
you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:<br><br>

Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)<br>
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F),<br>
when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103

increasing to 3 × 104
.)<br>

HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.<br><br>
So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd<br>
expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd<br>
need to know? Thanks.

<h1>Exotic dance moves</h1>
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To<br>
answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br><br>
Polynesian chicken dance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".<br>
Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.<br>
Arctic robot dance<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cold.
<br>

Yours sincerely,<br><br>
