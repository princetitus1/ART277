<h2>Travelling in Depression</h2><br>
<b>
When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought<br>
me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has<br>
given me a unique learning experience.<br><br>
At five, I <a href="https://www.starz.com/us/en/">marveled</a>  at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the<br>
heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways<br>
on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and<br>
<img src="girl.jpeg" width="300px" height="255px" style="float: left;"> walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the<br>
thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in<br>
<a href="https://starzit.com/bachelor-of-information-technology/">Starz University</a>.<br>
It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first<br>
became interested in language.<br>
It began with French, which taught me the importance of<br>
pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris<br>
where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it<br>
PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on<br>
the A, she looked at me bewildered.<br><br>
In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and<br>
aware of its similarities with English through cognates.<br>
Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks<br>
different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to<br>
me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates<br>
come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.<a href="mailto:princetitus49@gmail.com">Send Us Email</a><br> <br>
Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my<br>
school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I<br>

loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning<br>
fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means<br>
volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty<br>
and rhythm as I form them.
